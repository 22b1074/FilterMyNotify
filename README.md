# 🚀 FilterMyNotify 

A small Android app to filter WhatsApp and Gmail notifications based on:
- ✅ Selected contacts  
- ✅ Specific WhatsApp groups  
- ✅ Chosen email sender names  

## 📌 Why I built it  
Too many noisy notifications were breaking my focus — so I made this simple tool.

## 🛠️ Features  
- NotificationListenerService in Kotlin  
- SharedPreferences for saving filters  
- Real-time log updates  
- Clean UI  
- Plays sound only when filters match
